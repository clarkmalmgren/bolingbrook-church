    <h1>MISSION</h1>
    <h4>Developing Christ-like disciples of all ages and peoples.</h4>

    <p>
      We exist to help people become fully committed Christ-like disciples. This is more than just lip-service. We are passionate
      about helping people understand exactly who Jesus was, what he was talking about nearly two thousand years ago, and
      what that means for their lives today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our hope is that as they begin to understand his words, they begin to live it out in the everyday. We want them to be inspired
      to connect to other people who are trying to do the same, to serve others based on their passion, and to invite others
      to do the same by coming into their relationship with Jesus Christ.

    <h4>Creating spaces for the people God misses the most</h4>

    <p>
      The church we see goes far beyond the confines of church walls, but one that utilizes a multitude of spaces to create genuine
      relationships and facilitate growth. When we say spaces, we mean just that: houses of worship, schools, community centers,
      concert halls, art &amp; music centers you name it. We desire to create a multiplicity of spaces all over the world
      that make it possible for us to reach the ones God misses the most! For us, the people God misses the most are those
      who are far from having their own personal relationship with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether that means they gave up on church, or have never really explored God for themselves, we believe that those are the
      people God misses so deeply. So, we seek to provide an embracing multicultural community where the people God misses
      the most can freely inquire of God, and explore what Jesus teaches as they walk at their own pace nearer to Him. We
      believe that once people feel they belong, they can become inspired to believe Jesus’ plan for their life and begin
      engaging the world as Jesus sees it.

      RETHINK CHURCH

    <p>
      When you are finally at the point where you are trying to understand God and what He has planned for your life — it should
      be easy, not hard. Our desire is to create a space where relationships are authentic and appealing, messages are practical
      and scriptural, music is inspiring and ministry is transformative. We have done our best to keep church simple, but
      in order to do so we have had to be incredibly intentional. When Pastor Jose St. Phard and his wife Tiffany stepped
      into the Bolingbrook Church in 2012, they found an embracing multicultural community that had already been in existence
      since 1979. There was an assembly of 125+ believers gathering every Saturday eager to hear God’s word and live it out
      in their daily lives. Pastor Jose began to share the vision God had placed in his heart to reach those who had not
      yet considered God or had previously walked away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church began intentionally engaging this group of people and re-thinking how to do “church” for those who are seeking
      God, knowingly or unknowingly. Everything began to change and soon enough, God responded. The people God missed the
      most began coming our way, and they haven’t stopped coming! Today, the Bolingbrook Church has two services, averaging
      at 450+ people gathering every Saturday. While the church keeps its offices and midweek services at the Boughton Road
      location in Bolingbrook, all Saturday services are held in Romeoville, Illinois. This was necessary to accommodate
      for the growth we have continued to experience. We envision a church that will never cease to increase the Kingdom
      of God in this world, and we cannot even imagine what God has in store next for us as we continue to Rethink Church.
