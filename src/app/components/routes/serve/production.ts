        The Production Team at Bolingbrook Church is a group that is passionate about delivering only
        the very best for a God who deserves only the best. From the foundation of laying out miles of
        cables, to the setting up of our HD cameras, and to creating a distraction-free, worshipful
        environment with the use of state-of-the-art audio and lighting. It is our goal to create an
        atmosphere where one can interact with a God who is absolutely in love with them. If this sounds
        like something youâ€™d like to be a part of, sign up today! All our welcome to join! Training provided.
