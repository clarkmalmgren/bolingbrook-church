        We believe that God Loves without restraint; More than that, He is Love. He is all power and splendor and a mystery beyond
        words can describe. He is Immortal, Everliving, and all-loving, God is a relationship of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
        The only being worthy of our worship, God is our Creator, Redeemer and Friend. His ways are far beyond us, but He
        still reaches out to us. God is infinite yet intimate, three yet one, all-knowing yet all-forgiving. We will spend
        eternity cherishing an ever-deepening relationship with God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

        We believe that the Bible is the story of God striving to reconnect with His children, and is a major method God uses to
        reach us. It is the supreme source of truth for all humanity. It is the infallible revelation of God’s will towards
        us and for us. It is accurate, it has authority, and remains applicable to our lives today. Written by a mosaic of
        authors, styles and perspectives, the Bible reveals a God who is ever-creative, ever-patient and ever-seeking to
        restore our relationship with Him. Though written by ordinary people, through the Spirit it pierces our hearts, opens
        our eyes and convicts us to live for Him.

        We believe that Jesus is the Eternal Son of God. He is co-equal to God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Through Jesus, God
        the Father reached out to us most dramatically. It is through Him all things were created, and only in Him is God’s
        character ultimately revealed. Jesus chose not just to visit us, but become one of us. Born human so we can be reborn
        in the Spirit, Jesus showed us God’s love and character—and how far God was willing to go to save us from self-destruction.
        What we could not do for ourselves, He did for us, paying the price for our sins, dying in our place so we can live
        forever. He conquered death through resurrection, and promised to return to take us home.
