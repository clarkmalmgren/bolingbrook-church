      <h3>Your Generosity is Making a Difference.</h3>
      
      <p>
        We know your giving changes lives. The people God misses the most are constantly being reached because of your incredible
        generosity. At Bolingbrook Church, we want to make acting on your generosity rather simple.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Tithing is the beginning of giving</h3>
      
      <p>
        The Bible talks of tithing as the beginning point for giving. The word tithe literally means a tenth, that is 10% of our
        income. When we give the first 10% of our income to the church, we put God first in our lives and we help spread the
        story of His love. In fact, tithing is more than just giving something to God, it is giving back to God what He already
        gave to us. Of course, there is no way we can ever repay God for the ultimate gift of His Son on the cross, but in
        tithing we begin to express our gratitude, trust, and worship to Him who has given us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, our tithe helps support the global mission of the Seventh Day Adventist church and its Pastors.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Offering Helps Create Spaces for the People God misses the Most.</h3>
      
      <p>
        We are all called to be change agents in some way. When you give an offering to our local church it continues to fuel change
        in the lives of so many we serve on a weekly basis. Your offering makes our vision possible to see God work through
        a variety of spaces to reach the ones God misses the most.
      </p>

      <h3>More Opportunities to Give</h3>

      <h5>Food Pantry</h5>
      <p>
        The Bolingbrook Church Food Pantry has helped hundreds of families since its beginning. The number of families that receive
        groceries each month continues to grow. Join us in serving our community as many are facing difficult financial circumstances.
      </p>

      <h5>Crest Hill Christian School</h5>
      <p>
        The Crest Hill Christian School is one of our newest spaces in fulfilling the vision to reach the ones God misses the most.
        Our School exists to show children Jesus, nurture their love for Him and others, teach them to think, and empower
        them to serve. Join us in supporting our school.
      </p>

      <h5>Go &amp; Tell</h5>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever felt called by God to help plant a new church or help make more disciples, then this may be your opportunity.
        Go &amp; Tell funds help the Illinois Conference plant new churches throughout Illinois and give existing churches
        like ours more resources to spread the good news of God’s love.
