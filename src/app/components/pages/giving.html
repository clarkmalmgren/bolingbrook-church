      <h3>Tithing is the beginning of giving</h3>
      
      <p>
        The Bible talks of tithing as the beginning point for giving. The word tithe literally means a tenth, that is 10% of our
        income. When we give the first 10% of our income to the church, we put God first in our lives and we help spread the
        story of His love. In fact, tithing is more than just giving something to God, it is giving back to God what He already
        gave to us. Of course, there is no way we can ever repay God for the ultimate gift of His Son on the cross, but in
        tithing we begin to express our gratitude, trust, and worship to Him who has given us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, our tithe helps support the global mission of the Seventh Day Adventist church and its Pastors.

      <h3>Your Offering Helps Create Spaces for the People God misses the Most.</h3>
      
      <p>
        We are all called to be change agents in some way. When you give an offering to our local church it continues to fuel change
        in the lives of so many we serve on a weekly basis. Your offering makes our vision possible to see God work through
        a variety of spaces to reach the ones God misses the most.
