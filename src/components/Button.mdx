# Button

Primary UI component for user interaction. For purposes of reuse, there is a variant (pill) that isn't interactive
although the UI is nearly identical. The intended use cases are primary clickable buttons, menu items, and
sub-sectional headers.

## Primary Buttons

Used to draw attention to a call to action. This is the action that the user is supposed to take in order to
resolve a task or actually do something. This isn't just navigation, it should feel like a decision. For
example, use a primary button to "Join" a group but a menu item to navigate to the page about what groups
might exist.

<Canvas of={ ButtonStories.Primary } />

## Menu Items

Can be used in either the top menu bar or as items in a slide out drawer.

<Canvas of={ ButtonStories.MenuItem } />

## Sub-Section Header

Used as a eye-catching header for an informational sub-section.

<Canvas of={ ButtonStories.SubSectionHeader } />
