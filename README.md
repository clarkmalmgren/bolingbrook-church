## Services that make this Possible

This website is built and managed with services offered by amazing companies who help to make open source projects
like this one possible. Big thanks to the following:

![browserstack](https://github.com/clarkmalmgren/bolingbrook-church/raw/master/docs/browserstack.png)

Browserstack allows me to do testing on multiple browsers and OS setups that I don't have access to. This allows
me to support a user base that has a much broader technology base than I could ever personally achieve.
